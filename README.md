## Installation

### User Space Installation (No sudo required!)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/RyAnPr1Me/cli.git
cd cli

# Run the user space installer
./install.sh
```

The installer will:
1. Install the package in `~/.local` (user space)
2. Add the `mcli` command to your PATH
3. No root/sudo privileges required!

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Install in user space with pip
python3 -m pip install --user -e .

# Make sure ~/.local/bin is in your PATH
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Add the PATH export to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile` to make it permanent.

## Usage

After installation, use the `mcli` command:

```bash
# Get help
mcli --help

# Get help for a specific command group
mcli files --help
mcli network --help

# Example commands
mcli files duplicates ~/Documents          # Find duplicate files
mcli files diskusage ~/Downloads --human   # Show disk usage
mcli network checkport google.com 443      # Check if port is open
mcli network speedtest                     # Test network speed
mcli system info                           # Show system information
mcli system monitor --count 5              # Monitor resources
mcli process list --sort memory            # List processes by memory
mcli utils hash "my text"                  # Generate hashes
mcli utils tree . --depth 3                # Display directory tree
```

## Examples

### Find duplicate files in your Downloads folder
```bash
mcli files duplicates ~/Downloads --min-size 10240
```

### Check which ports are open locally
```bash
mcli network portscan 8000 8100 --host 127.0.0.1
```

### Monitor system resources
```bash
mcli system monitor --interval 2 --count 10
```

### Find all Python processes
```bash
mcli process find python
```

### Compare two files
```bash
mcli utils compare file1.txt file2.txt
```

### Display directory structure
```bash
mcli utils tree ~/Projects --depth 3
```

## Working Around User Space Restrictions

This tool is designed to work entirely in user space and handle common macOS restrictions:

1. **No root required** - All commands run with user privileges
2. **Graceful permission handling** - Commands skip files/directories when permission is denied
3. **User process management** - Can only manage processes owned by the current user
4. **Network operations** - Uses unprivileged ports and standard network APIs
5. **File system access** - Works within user's accessible directories
6. **System information** - Gathers data from user-accessible APIs (psutil)

## Requirements

- macOS 10.14 or later
- Python 3.7 or later (usually pre-installed on macOS)
- pip (Python package manager)

## Dependencies

The tool uses these Python packages (automatically installed):
- `click` - Command-line interface framework
- `psutil` - System and process utilities
- `requests` - HTTP library for network testing

## Development

```bash
# Install in development mode
python3 -m pip install --user -e .

# Run tests (if available)
python3 -m pytest

# Uninstall
python3 -m pip uninstall macos-cli-tools
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found: mcli
Make sure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### Permission denied errors
Some commands may not be able to access all files/processes due to macOS security restrictions. This is normal and expected in user space.

### Python version issues
Make sure you're using Python 3.7 or later:
```bash
python3 --version
```

## Platform Support

While optimized for macOS, most commands will work on Linux and other Unix-like systems. macOS-specific features (clipboard operations) gracefully fail on other platforms.
